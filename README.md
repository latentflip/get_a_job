# GET A Job

A Hypermedia Job Queue example

## A note about rails

This was generated with edge Rails. If you want to do the same, do this:

```
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/rails/rails.git
$ cd rails
$ rake install
$ gem build rails.gemspec # I had to build the meta-gem too...
$ gem install rails-4.0.0.beta.gem
$ cd ..
$ gem install rails-api
$ rails-api new get_a_job
```

The issue is that you can bundle edge rails with the app, but then the
generated app isn't with 4.0.0... There might be an easier way to do this, but
I thought it was pretty simple.
